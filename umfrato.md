UMFRATO is an award-winning tool for survey creation, completion and evaluation made by an agile team of 7 students during the Software Engineering course in summer 2020.

The frontend was made with Vue.js and Javascript, while for the backend we used the Spring framework.

I was mainly responsible for the frontend-part of the project since I already had some practical experience with Vue and Javascript.

Here you can see some of the main functonalities of the app. It is in german, but it is not hard to make out the purpose of each component.

You can create a new design for a survey with a logo, colors, patterns and other details.

A nice overview displays all designs, filtered by different criteria:
