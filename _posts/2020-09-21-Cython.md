Here I show how, starting from pure, short and dirty Python code, to achieve greater speed and less memory usage.

---
When building a library, I often find myself in situations where I want to speed up some <i>part</i> of the code. Usually this is a utility directory which provides basic algorithms. As an example, once I was working on a library for Spectral graph theory, one of my favorite topics in discrete math/LA, and I had to compute the shortest path between two vertices of a graph. Of course, it would be much more sensible to use C# or C++ but it would be even more unreasonable to transition my whole codebase to a language that I am not that familiar with, or to try to call it from Python. 

This is exactly the use case for Cython. It allows you to write efficient code in C, Python or mixture of both. The pitfall is that the more efficient your code gets, the less readability you have. This means that you can profit entirely from this tradeoff in the scenario described above, where the functions don't change with time. 

Lets start with a simple example: Hamming distance between strings of equal length. This is the number of positions at which both strings differ. 

The first that comes into my mind is following one-liner (or two if you wish).
```python
def hamming(s1, s2):  
    return sum([x[0] == x[1] for x in zip(s1, s2)])
``` 
Although concise, the code suffers from a few drawbacks: 
1. The `zip` function returns an iterator which could be processed efficiently. Instead, we create a whole list out of it and then take the sum.  
2. Just like in most Python code, types of variables need to be inferred which requires more space and time.

In order to convert the function to Cython, we first create a `dist.pyx` file and rewrite the function. Then, we create a `setup.py` with the compilation instructions. The steps are very well explained in the [documentation](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/source_files_and_compilation.html).

As you can reassure yourself, this alone gives us a speedup of about 160%. The numbers and runtimes vary between different machines and codes, so as a measure of efficiency, I will use the number of Python interactions within the Cython code. After compilation, you will find a `dist.html` file in the same folder, provided that you have specified this in the setup. 

This is what we see when we open the file in a browser:

Each line of code in `dist.html` is of different shade of yellow and the brighter the line, the more Python interaction it has. White lines are written in pure C, which is what we are at. You can also expand a line to see the C code generated from Cython. You can learn a lot about how Python (and also C) works by inspecting those lines. Here is how the function signature looks like:

You don't need to understand the meaning of this code, but it is helpful to know why and when Cython generates additional code. In our case, this is because we have a pure Python function and the arguments need to be converted to a PyObject. Unless you call the function a dozen of times, this need not bother you, but for the sake of the argument, we will convert it to a C signature:
```c
cpdef int hamming(char *d1, char *d2):
``` 
The keyword `cpdef` means that this is a C function which call be called from outside Cython. This is not possible for C only functions, for which you'll need to create a wrapper. Note also that since the arguments are byte arrays, the correct way to call the function will be ```hamming(b'ATCG',b'AATC')```. You can read more on bytes and Unicode strings [here](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/tutorial/strings.html).

Now lets turn to the content of the function. As mentioned before, converting the iterator to a list and taking the sum is not efficient. We'll change the code as follows:
```python
cpdef int hamming(char *d1, char *d2):
	l = zip(d1, d2)
	
    c = 0
    for i in l:
	    if i[0] == i[1]:
		    c += 1
	return c
``` 
This is probably the more common way to implement the Hamming distance (but not really pythonic if you ask me). Nevertheless, this will give you a performance boost even if you are not doing it in Cython. Let's see how 'yellow' the code is:

Despite the performance boost, this does not look much better as to our metric. This is because the low-level code generated is roughly the same size - we still don't know at compile time what the variables `i`, `c` and `l` are. The next step will be thus to introduce types:
```c
cdef Py_ssize_t c
cdef (char, char) i
```

The first variable is of `Py_ssize_t` type, which means that it stores the length of a sequence. We could also use an `int` for this, but this is better to use this for indexing since it is signed. The second variable is just a tuple of two characters which we get from the `zip` function. I couldn't find an appropriate type for the variable `l` and since it not in the core documentation, it is probably too complicated.

The next thing to change will be to remove the `zip` function, remove the additional variable `l` entirely and work only over the input strings. In general, this may be the first step you'll want to do, but I supposed this transition would be easier to follow.  The final code looks like this:
```c
cpdef int hamming(char *s1, char *s2):  
    cdef Py_ssize_t c, i, l  
    l = len(s1)  
    c = 0  
    for i in range(l):  
        if s1[i] == s2[i]:  
            c += 1  
  return c
```

Note that in general you should also include a check that `len(s1) == len(s2)` in order to sanitize the user input, which I omitted for the sake of simplicity.

To further speed up the code, you can disable the bound checking when iterating over an array, as well as the wraparound when using negative indices by putting the following two lines at the top of the file. 
```python
# cython: boundscheck=False  
# cython: wraparound=False 
```
Note that when using them, you must be sure that negative indices won't appear and that indices will be always in bounds, otherwise you risk data corruption.

Now the output should look like this:

Overall, I managed to reduce the runtime from 0.5 sec. to 0.03 sec., or roughly 17 times!
