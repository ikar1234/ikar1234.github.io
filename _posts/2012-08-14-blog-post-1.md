Here I present an interesting way of formulating the constraints in an optimization problem, namely in terms of differential geometry.

Note: This post is based on the great notes I found [http://noodle.med.yale.edu/~hdtag/notes/steifel_notes.pdf](here). My goal is to provide an intuition of the problem as well as to provide a neat strategy of how to formulate and approach constrained optimization problems. If you want to go deeper into the math you should check the notes. 

Problem formulation
======

Suppose we have following optimization problem:


Here, we may be interested in the matrix $X$, or we may want to find $p$ ortogonal vectors which are optimal wrt. to a score function. This problem has applications for example in RNNs.

The first step is to show that the space of orthogonal matrices is a manifold. This is a very theoretical and tedious step and, unless you are a pure mathematician with experience in the field, you should check if someone has already found that for you. If not, you should try another approach. In our case, a proof is given in <cite>[1]</cite>, Example 6.10.

Aren't headings cool?
