This web page allows users to create, edit and share galleries. 

The user can upload images to a gallery, and select a thumbnail to represent this gallery.

Users can also share their galleries with other users, and collaborate in joint projects.

User and gallery data are stored in MongoDB. 

Images are locally stored, but in case that the traffic increases, an AWS storage service will be considered. 

Here's the link to the app, if you want to try it yourself:
