UMFRATO is an award-winning tool for survey creation and evaluation made by an agile team of 7 students during the Software Engineering course in summer 2020.
The frontend was made with Vue.js and Javascript, while for the backend we used the Spring framework.
I was mainly responsible for the frontend-part of the project since I already had some practical experience with Vue and Javascript.

Here you can see some of the main functonalities of the app.
